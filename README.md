# Next.js 15 API Route 404 Bug

This repository demonstrates a sporadic 404 error encountered in Next.js 15 API routes.  The error appears inconsistently, making debugging difficult.  It may be related to the use of the `app` directory or specific middleware configurations. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Access `/api/hello` in your browser.

Sometimes this will return a 200 OK with the expected JSON, and sometimes it will return a 404.  The inconsistency is the key problem.

## Potential Causes

* **Middleware conflicts:**  Middleware might interfere with API route handling.
* **`app` directory interactions:**  Interactions between API routes and the `app` directory structure might cause conflicts.
* **Next.js bug:** It's possible there is an underlying bug in Next.js itself. 

## Solution (in helloSolution.js)
 The solution might involve carefully reviewing middleware, ensuring correct path configurations, or waiting for a potential Next.js fix.
